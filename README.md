# 👋 Hi, I'm Aryaa!

🎓 CS Student at Tufts University (Class of 2027)  
📈 I'm interested in further exploring machine learning, full-stack development & tech for social impact  

I’m passionate about using technology to solve meaningful, real-world problems. I've loved applying what 
I learn in class to real-world projects. As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow and a ML researcher at Tufts, I’m exploring 
machine learning, data pipelines, and inclusive innovation. I’m also a teaching assistant and full-stack developer with
experience in both front-end and back-end tools.

Currently, I’m looking to deepen my experience in data science, machine learning, and software engineering through hands-on 
internships and collaboration opportunities.

✨ **Fun Fact:** 
I love Studio Ghibli movies and often work while listening to their soundtracks. 
There’s a specific playlist I’ve probably played over a thousand times because it keeps me focused!
